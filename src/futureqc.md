-I want to keep testing this app
--1/5 nights not being an all-nighter === my brain is fucked

-How do you test Router?

-Passing in mock props to test components

-Why doesn't it like the conditional render in Favorites?

-How would you test that the email button opens default email?

-Add CSS styles/Redux functionality to loved videos

-PropTypes warning--do more research. Or do what everone on stackoverflow seems
 to be doing, which is wait until PRs are closed and things get updated
 
-Heroku? GH Pages? Firebase?
--Brenna and I talked about publishing on Heroku, but it seems like you need
  a back-end to push to Heroku. When I tried pushing to Heroku, I got a 503 error, 
  which means the site's server isn't available right now. I don't have a server.
  --I can eject and publish to GH Pages
  --I also read something about a PHP file you can add to a static page that will
    make Heroku think there's a back-end
  --It might also be nice to eventually have a back-end that handles data so that 
    my app doesn't depend on mocked data
    --That said, at this point, why? I don't want people to be able to contribute w/o
      their data being validated, and the whole point of this app is that EDM genre 
      data is hard to validate.
    --I don't know that I want users either
    --But I do want a feature that will email users a playlist
      --Based on my research, that requires a back-end
