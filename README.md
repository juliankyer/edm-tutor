### Julian Kyer 

This is the first project I've ever been willing to stay up all night for. Multiple nights in a row. 

The opening video gives me chills, and my ears hurt after being wrapped in maxed-out headphones for days. My body wants exercise, sleep, and food, but my heart wants to keep making this project better. The opening page loads, and no matter how tired I am, I can't turn the volume down. 

Maybe I'm just excited to be back under the electric sky. Maybe I'm just so sleepy that all I can dream about is the feeling of bass hitting me in the chest like a fist. All I know is that I want to share that feeling with you. That feeling of music connecting you to something bigger than yourself. The feeling that no speakers in the world are loud enough.

Below are some notes, mostly for me. The markdown below will be updated as the app develops. But from here up, the message stays the same. 
### I want to help find what makes you move.

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES 

First, I know. Autoplay. It's on purpose.

##### Testing:
* I want to keep testing this app

##### UI/UX
* Add CSS styles/Redux functionality to loved videos
* Let's make this responsive for mobile/tablet
* A logo.
* ...and a better font.

--It might also be nice to eventually have a back-end that handles data so that 
  my app doesn't depend on mocked data
  --I also don't want people to be able to contribute w/o
    their data being validated, since the whole point of this app is that EDM genre 
    data is hard to validate.
  --I don't know that I want registered users either
  --But I do want a feature that will email users a playlist
      
--Why does the opening page do that weird block of color before it renders fully?
