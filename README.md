# EDMTut.r

EDMTut.r is an app designed to teach people about different genres of EDM.
Built with React, Router, Redux, Create React App, CSS3 and HTML5.

[Deployed on a budget here](http://edm-tutor.surge.sh/)

### Julian Kyer 

This is the first project I've ever been willing to stay up all night for. Multiple nights in a row. 

The opening video gives me chills, and my ears hurt after being wrapped in maxed-out headphones for days. My body wants exercise, sleep, and food, but my heart wants to keep making this project better. The opening page loads, and no matter how tired I am, I can't turn the volume down. 

Maybe I'm just excited to be back under the electric sky. Maybe I'm just so sleepy that all I can dream about is the feeling of bass hitting me in the chest like a fist. All I know is that I want to share that feeling with you. That feeling of music connecting you to something bigger than yourself. The feeling that no speakers in the world are loud enough.

### I want to help find what makes you move.

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES 

First, I know. Autoplay. It's on purpose. After much internal debate, I chose to autoplay my videos. I figure if you're coming here, you're curious about my opinion on EDM. And you don't click play at a concert.

##### UI/UX
* Add CSS styles/Redux functionality to loved videos
* Let's make this responsive for mobile/tablet
* A logo.
* ...and a better font.

--It might also be nice to eventually have a back-end that handles data so that 
  my app doesn't depend on big, ugly JSON files
  --I also don't want people to be able to contribute w/o
    their data being validated, since the whole point of this app is that EDM genre 
    data is hard to validate.
  --I want a feature that will email users a playlist
      
--Why does the opening page do that weird block of color before it renders fully?
